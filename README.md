# Coulomb-Regularization
The equations of motion of an electron in a Coulomb+Electric field potential are regularized at the Coulomb singularity.

Due to the 1/r singularity in the Coulomb potential (+ any other non-singular potential), usual integration methods fail at r->0. This program can integrate the trajectories in 3D without any such difficulties. This is achieved by writing down the equations in the Extended Hamiltonian and transforming coordinates in to semi-parbolic coordinates. The program can handle both time dependent/independent potentials. 

The derivation of formulas can be found in the Appendix of the following publication.
